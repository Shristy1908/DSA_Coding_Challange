Given two strings a and b consisting of lowercase characters. The task is to check whether two given strings are an anagram of each other or not. An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example, act and tac are an anagram of each other.

Input:a = geeksforgeeks, b = forgeeksgeeks
Output: YES

code:-  


class Solution
{    
    //Function is to check whether two strings are anagram of each other or not.
    public static boolean isAnagram(String a,String b)
    {
        boolean result=true;
        
          if(a.length()==a.length()){
            
             char[] arr1=a.toCharArray();
             char[] arr2=b.toCharArray();
        
        
             Arrays.sort(arr1);
             Arrays.sort(arr2);
            
            result=Arrays.equals(arr1,arr2);
       }    
        return result;   
    }
}
